### Hereâ€™s the full flow to commit and deploy:

#### ðŸ”§ 1. **Run the build step (if required before deploy)**

If your deployment platform **requires built files** (like a `dist/` or `build/` folder):

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates production-ready files.

#### ðŸ§ª 2. **Test locally (optional, but good practice)**

To make sure it works before you commit:

```bash
npm start
```

Make sure the app runs as expected.

#### âœ… 3. **Stage, commit, and push your change**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: updated feature or bug fix description"
git push origin main
```
